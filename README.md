Description
-----------
A javascript version of my resume that includes information such as my work experience and projects. This was my very first project I made and was fundamental to my learning of javascript. This project taught me a lot of the intricacies of javascript and its role in web development. Even though this project may not be the most advanced per se, I am the most proud of this project because it signifies the first big step I took towards becoming a we developer.
